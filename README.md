Hello my name is Ryan Rouleau and I am currently a Junior pursuing my undergraduate Aerospace Engineering Degree at Iowa State University. Outside of the classroom I pursue my interest in aircraft performance and design as the Development Team Leader of Boeing Experimental Flight within the M2I program ✈️. Some of my other hobbies include playing/coaching hockey 🏒, traveling to various national parks 🏞️, and spending time with family and friends. I am new to GitHub and its accompanying feature so any recommendations would be greatly appreciated!
